 bedops version: 1.2
        authors: Shane Neph & Scott Kuehn

      USAGE: bedops [process-flags] <operation> <File(s)>*
          Every input file must be sorted per the sort-bed utility.
          May use '-' for a file to indicate reading from standard input.
          Each operation requires a minimum number of files as shown below.
            There is no fixed maximum number of files that may be used.
          Input files must have at least the first 3 columns of the BED specification,
            and every end coordinate must be 1 bp beyond the end of its interval.

      Process Flags:
          --ec                Error check input files (slower).
          --help              Print this message and exit successfully.
          --help-<operation>  Detailed help on <operation>.
                                An example is --help-c or --help--complement
          --range <val>       Pad input file(s) symmetrically by <val> which may be
                                negative to shrink or remove regions.  With -e/-n
                                operations, the first/reference file is not padded.

      Operations: (choose one of)
          -c, --complement [-L] File1 [File]*
          -d, --difference ReferenceFile File2 [File]*
          -e, --element-of [-number% | -number (in bp)] ReferenceFile File2 [File]*
                 by default, -e -100% is used.
          -i, --intersect File1 File2 [File]*
          -m, --merge File1 [File]*
          -n, --not-element-of [-number% | -number (in bp)] ReferenceFile File2 [File]*
                 by default, -n -100% is used.
          -s, --symmdiff File1 File2 [File]*
          -u, --everything File1 [File]*

      NOTE: Only operations -e|n|u preserve all columns (no flattening)
        Example: bedops --range 10 -u file1.bed
