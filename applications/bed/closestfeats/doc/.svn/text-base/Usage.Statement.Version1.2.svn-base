Usage: closestFeatures [Process-Flags] [Output-Option] <input-file> <query-file>
   All input files must be sorted per sort-bed.
   May use '-' for a file to indicate reading from standard input.

   For every element in <input-file>, determine the two elements from <query-file> falling
     nearest to its left and right edges.  An 'Output-Option' may be set to report results
     in any one of a variety of ways.

  Process Flags:
    --ec            : Error check all input files (slower).
    --delim <delim> : Change output delimiter from '|' to <delim> between columns (e.g. '\t')
    --no-overlaps   : Overlapping elements from <query-file> will not be reported.
                        Useful, for example, with --5P if reported elements must be upstream.
    --no-ref        : Do not echo elements from <input-file>.
    --dist          : Print the signed distance(s) to the <input-file> element as an additional
                        column(s) of output.  An overlapping element has a distance of 0.

  Output-Option (At most, one may be selected.):
    Without --no-ref, all output options include the <input-file> element as the first field.
    By default, also print the two elements from <query-file> that lie genomically closest
      to the left and right edges of the <input-file> element, respectively.

    --5P       : Print closest element to 5' edge of <input-file> element.
    --3P       : Print closest element to 3' edge of <input-file> element.
    --shortest : Print closest element only.  Ties go the left element.
    --left     : Print closest element to left edge of <input-file> element only.
    --right    : Print closest element to right edge of <input-file> element only.

    --5P and --3P require at least 6 fields in the <input-file>, where the 6th column
      indicates strand (either + or -), while the <query-file> requires only 3 columns.
    All other options, including the default behavior, require 3 columns in both files.

  NOTES:
    If an element from <query-file> overlaps the <input-file> element, its distance is zero.
      An overlapping element take precedence over all non-overlapping elements.  This is true
      even when the overlapping element's edge-to-edge distance to the <input-file>'s element
      is greater than the edge-to-edge distance from a non-overlapping element.
    Overlapping elements may be ignored completely (no precedence) with --no-overlaps.
    Elements reported as genomically closest to the left and right edges are never the same.
    When no qualifying element from <query-file> exists as a closest feature, 'NA' is reported.
