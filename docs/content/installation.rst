Installation
============

======================
Via pre-built packages
======================

Pre-built binaries offer the easiest installation option for uses of BEDOPS. At this time, we offer binaries for 32- and 64-bit versions of Linux and OS X (Intel) platforms.

Linux

1. Download the 32- or 64-bit package for Linux.
2. Extract the package to a location of your choice. 
   In the case of 32-bit Linux:
   ::
       $ tar jxvf bedops_linux_i386-vx.y.z.tar.bz2
   In the case of 64-bit Linux:
   ::
       $ tar jxvf bedops_linux_x86_64-vx.y.z.tar.bz2
   Replace ``x``, ``y`` and ``z`` with the version number of BEDOPS you have downloaded.
3. Copy the extracted binaries to a location of your choice which is in your environment's ``PATH``, *e.g.* ``~/opt/bin``:
   ::
       $ cp bin/* ~/opt/bin

1. Download the Mac OS X installer for BEDOPS.
2. Locate the installer package (usually located in ``~/Downloads`` &emdash; this will depend on your web browser configuration).
