`bedmap`
========

The ``bedmap`` program is used to retrieve and process signal or other features over regions of interest in BED files (including DNase hypersensitive regions, SNPs, transcription factor binding sites, etc.), performing tasks such as: :ref:`smoothing raw tag <smoothing_raw_tags>` count signal in preparation for uploading to the UCSC Genome Browser, :ref:`finding subsets of elements <finding_elements_within_elements>` within a larger coordinate set, :ref:`filtering multiple BED files <master_list>` by signal, :ref:`finding multi-input overlap <multiple_inputs>` solutions, and much, much more.
